# Bash_Simulation
Using a tree data structure we are able to simulate a bash terminal.
the program allows you to 
  - create a directory in the tree
  - find and move to a directory with given name
  - print the working directory of the tree
  - print all child directory or file nodes
  - or prints the directory tree starting from the cursor

The program will check whether the directory is full or if the directory exists
